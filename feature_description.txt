In my project, inside the **my-website** folder, update only the main homepage that appears first when the website opens. Rules: - Do NOT delete any files or components anywhere in the project. - Only remove ONE element: the button that says **“Docusaurus tutorial - 5 minutes”**. - All other content must remain untouched. Styling Tasks: - Change the homepage visual theme using **Custom CSS only**. - Update background color to a new modern Physical AI theme. - Improve button styles (colors, hover, border radius). - Update font styles and heading design to premium quality. - Apply a clean, modern color palette such as: - Deep Navy, Matte Black, Cyber Orange, Neon Blue (or any recommended futuristic colors). - Make the homepage look elegant, premium, and robotics-inspired. - Do not change layout structure or logic — only CSS styling. Do not modify any other pages, components, or files. Only update the homepage styling and remove that one button.
