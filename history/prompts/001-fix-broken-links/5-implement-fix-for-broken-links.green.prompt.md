## Prompt

/sp.implement

## Response snapshot

I have completed all the tasks in `tasks.md`. The implementation is complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implemented the fix for the broken links.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run due to system restrictions.
- 📁 Files: Modified `my-website/docusaurus.config.ts` and `specs/001-fix-broken-links/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation was straightforward, but the verification was blocked by system restrictions.
