# Introduction to Physical AI & Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Robotics. This documentation explores the fascinating convergence of artificial intelligence with tangible, embodied systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through a physical body. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI involves aspects of robotics, mechanics, and sensorimotor control, allowing AI to perceive, act, and learn within physical environments.

## Scope of this Document

This guide will cover:
*   The foundational concepts of Physical AI.
*   The evolution and current state of Robotics.
*   The specifics of Humanoid Robots.
*   The emerging field of Embodied AI Systems.

We aim to provide a research-focused, clean, and well-structured resource for students, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.
