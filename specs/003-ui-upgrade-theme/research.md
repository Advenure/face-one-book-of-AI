**Date**: December 7, 2025
**Feature**: specs/003-ui-upgrade-theme/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/003-ui-upgrade-theme/plan.md

## Research Summary

The feature specification for "Upgrade UI to Premium Physical AI/Robotics Theme with Defined Palette" explicitly provides the required color palette and detailed aesthetic guidelines. Consequently, no specific external research or further clarification regarding the design aesthetic is required beyond the established design principles.

## Decisions & Rationale

*   **Decision**: No additional research or external design consultation is needed. The provided color palette and aesthetic instructions are sufficient.
*   **Rationale**: The user's input for this feature included a clear definition of "energetic robotics colors" with specific Hex values, and detailed descriptions of the desired visual style (futuristic, clean fonts, animations, gradients, neon highlights, etc.). This resolves previous potential ambiguities in aesthetic interpretation.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: N/A, as explicit guidance was provided.

## Aesthetic Design Principles (Based on User-Provided Palette)

*   **Color Palette (User-Provided)**:
    *   Deep Navy: `#0A0F1C` (Primary Base, Backgrounds)
    *   Electric Orange: `#FF7A00` (Accent, Highlights)
    *   Neon Blue: `#4BA3FF` (Accent, Highlights, Interactive elements)
    *   Soft Gray: `#E3E6EB` (Text, Secondary elements, Contrast)
*   **Typography**: Futuristic, clean fonts (e.g., modern sans-serifs with a technical feel).
*   **Animations**: Smooth hover effects and light animations.
*   **Backgrounds**: Gradients or subtle patterns matching Physical AI aesthetics.
*   **Elements**: Elegant, modern, outclass hero section, headings, buttons, feature cards.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: Enhanced spacing, font sizes, and overall visual organization.

These principles, guided by the user's specific palette, will inform the custom CSS implementation.
