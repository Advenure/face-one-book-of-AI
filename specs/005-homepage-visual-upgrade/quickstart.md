# Quickstart: Running the Website Locally

This guide provides the steps to run the Docusaurus website locally to view the changes.

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Steps

1.  **Navigate to the website directory**:
    Open your terminal and change into the `my-website` directory.

    ```bash
    cd my-website
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    If you haven't already, install the necessary npm packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**:
    Run the start command to build the site and launch a local development server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  **View the Website**:
    The command will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to the URL shown in your terminal, which is typically:

    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The homepage will reflect the new visual styles. The local server supports hot-reloading, so any further changes to the CSS files will be applied automatically without needing to restart the server.
